;; Chrome is dynamically linked against libGLX and libEGL from the libglvnd library.
;; Libglvnd acts as a proxy/dispatcher that routes OpenGL API calls to the appropriate
;; backend provider (such as Mesa or proprietary drivers). It selects which implementation
;; to use at runtime based on available drivers.

;; However, in Guix, the version of libglvnd (or its integration with the rest of the stack)
;; may be outdated or incompatible, resulting in Chrome encountering `undefined symbol` errors
;; during library loading.

;; To work around this issue, I created a custom package that adds `mesa` to the runtime
;; dependencies. Crucially, `mesa` is prepended to the `inputs` list, so it appears first
;; in the generated LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

;; As a result, nonguix's build system (via the chromium-binary-build-system) generates a
;; wrapper script that sets LD_LIBRARY_PATH in the correct order. This ensures that Chrome
;; attempts to load libGLX and libEGL directly from Mesa first, avoiding conflicts or missing
;; symbols caused by relying solely on libglvnd.
